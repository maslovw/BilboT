**Request**: start from writing to-do list in doc/ToDo.md
- I want to make a telegram bot (name BilboT), that will be able to receive photo of a receipt and store it localy for future analysis.
- bot should support recognizing user and it should be able to diffrentiate messages from the same user in different groups
- bot should store image in preconfigured folder
- bot should use sql light to store information: date and time of the message, data and time of the receipt (will be deducted later in analysis step), user name, user id, group id where message was received, comments that were added to the image.
- script for the bot should request token via keyring.get_password("telegram_bilbo", socket.gethostname())
